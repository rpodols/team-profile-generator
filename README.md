# Team Profile Generator - Challenge 10

## Description
This project is the tenth challenge of the coding bootcamp.

User Story: As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info, so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

Starting from scratch, this challenge required writing code to do the following:
* Given a command-line application that acceps user input, when I am prompted for my team numbers and their information, then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
* When I click on an email address in the HTML, then my default Email program opens and populates the 'to' field of the email with the address.
* When I click on the GitHub username, then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
* When I start the application, then I am prompted to enter the team manager's name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
* When I enter the team manager's name, employee ID, email address, and office number, then I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.
* When I select the engineer option, then I am prompted to enter the engineer's name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.
* When I select the intern option, then I am prompted to enter the intern's name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.
* When I decide to finish building my team, then I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
